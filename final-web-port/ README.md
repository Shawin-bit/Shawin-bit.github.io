At the start of this big project, i was really ambitous to try new things that i have learnt over the semester! MY greatest skills are html, css, and also making it abit tidy. I really enjoy coding and everything about it, its like a big puzzle.
 I spent hours working my nav bar, I was going to go with a collasible hamburger menu for mobile view, but that proved to be more difficult than simple. I chose the simple way of doing the nav, which is still very nice. 

 MY header was something that i wanted to stand out and say HELLO, so i made it bigger than everything.

 For the Main INDEX.HTML, which took days, I was showcasing my past work, and just optimizing all the image so they would fit prefectly in the main page. all the images were link to the page "my work". 
 I was ambitous once again on my work page, i tried so hard to make a image gallery for all my different projects, but again i couldnt figure it out, so i just made an image gallery on the page. I'm hoping in the future i can do this sort of thing!

 over all, I really tried super hard to try new things, but eventually i just couldnt figure it out after hours and hours of trying. some of my coding were clean and precise, like my contact page. its so simple and mordern.
 The about page was just a simple intro to myself.

 Anyway this is my final!
